## 📖 Overview

The **Universal AI Insights Platform** is an intelligent business analytics tool that automatically analyzes any dataset you upload and generates contextual insights, visualizations, and recommendations — all powered by advanced AI.

Unlike traditional analytics tools that require manual configuration, this platform detects your business domain (**marketing**, **finance**, **HR**, **SaaS**, **sales**, or **e-commerce**), identifies key metrics, and provides instant analysis without setup.

Simply upload your CSV or Excel file, and the AI will:

- Detect your business context based on column names and data patterns  
- Generate KPI dashboards with trend indicators and performance metrics  
- Create interactive visualizations showing patterns and relationships in your data  
- Answer questions in natural language through an AI chat interface  
- Provide actionable insights with business-focused recommendations  

This tool bridges the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making, making analytics accessible to everyone — **no SQL, Python, or data science expertise required**.
